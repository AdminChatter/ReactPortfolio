                    I am a passionate and dedicated software developer based in Mississauga, ON, with a diverse professional background and a strong foundation in web and software development. Recently, I graduated from a rigorous part-time Software Development Bootcamp, where I honed my skills in modern programming languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, Python, React, and SQL. The program equipped me with the ability to build robust web applications, develop full-stack solutions, and implement AI-assisted tools for enhanced coding efficiency. Drawing on my experience in team collaboration and customer-focused roles, I bring excellent problem-solving skills and a proactive attitude to software development. I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments.
